# PolyBool
Provides boolean operations (union, intersection, difference, xor) for 2D polygons.

This is an optimised version of EgoMoose's PolyBool port (https://github.com/EgoMoose/PolyBool-Lua).

The original PolyBool repo can be found here: https://github.com/velipso/polybooljs

This library was initially a small undertaking for personal use, but I'm open sourcing it since other people may find it
valuable. While I might drop in to fix a few bugs or tweak a couple things, I don't make guarantees about maintenance or
whether this is bug-free - use at your own risk.
